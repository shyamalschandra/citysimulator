Goal: A video game to provide a discrete simulation of someone with power in the city to decide whether to randomly choose a solution to a fire, ER, or police ficitious problem in the Kansas areas. 

Before every turn, the user gets a four-choices where they can decide whether he or she will win more time by giving the right choice or lose time by giving the wrong choice.

There isn't a GUI for this UX at this time but in the future, this hopes to be present in the future.

Here is a screenshot:
